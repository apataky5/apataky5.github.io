            Hi! My name is Alyssa, and I created this little site for my class on web design!
            I am 24 and a second-year student at the University of Michigan focusing on Libraries and Archives.
            Looking towards my career I would like to be a public librarian, maybe even a children's librarian.
            I am unsure at the moment exactly what I want to be which I have discovered is quite normal for this degree.

        <div>
           <p tabindex="0">
            I decided to dedicate this website to myself and things that interest me,
            it's basically just like my personal blog except I did all the hard work of making it. I will give you a quick tour of the other pages on here. 
            First, we have a travel page where the photos are from my most recent travel experience, 
            a trip I took to Scotland in 2019. Next is a page devoted to my recent crochet projects.
            I have a passion for crochet and any chance I can show off my creations I will take it!
            Then we have the current reads page. As an aspiring librarian I feel this is a necessary page to have.
            Finally, we have the follow me page, where you can put in your information and receive emails about future updates to my site, or you can just leave me feedback!
            </p>
