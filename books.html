        <p id = "main" tabindex="0"> I know being in grad school makes it so it's really hard to find the time and the patience to read 
            outside of class. Over this past semester I have found reading for pleasure to be a wonderful distraction from 
            everything happening in the world. Here's what I am reading currently:

        <h2 class="wilde" tabindex="0"> The Wild Irish Girl; a National Tale by Sydney Owenson, Lady Morgan </h2>
        <img class = "irish" src="imgs/irish.jpg" alt="the oxford classic version of The Wild Irish Girl by Sydney Owenson"  tabindex="0">
        
        <p class= "wordy" tabindex="0"> I have never heard of this book until I was reading a magazine about Romanticism and they talked about this book
            and the author. I do love the Romantic era so I was instantly drawn to this book. First published in 1806, the basic plot being that a young man is exiled to
            his father's country estate in Ireland and meets and Irish princess and falls in love. It is considered a nationalist story as
            the young man and the princess represent England and Ireland and their recent union and the hope that 
            the then recent union between Ireland and England would be a happy one. *Spoiler alert* in real life the union between
            Ireland and England was most definitely an unhappy one. The story is mostly told through 
            letters and it reminds me very much of Dracula as that is told in the manner. I am excited to delve deeper into the story
            and get to the melodramatic bits.
