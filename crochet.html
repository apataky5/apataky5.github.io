    <h1> Crochet </h1>
    <p id = "main">
        I leanred how to crochet in middle school and created my first scarf then. After that I gave up due to the scarf being so uneven and 
        ugly. I later tried again in college, and succeded in making a slightly less ugly scarf. After that I felt hooked.
        I asked my mother to help me learn how to read patterns and learn other stitches. 
        She obliged and soon I had a pair of mittens. I then worked my way up through hats and mittens, to blankets, to amigurumi, and finally creating 
        sweaters and cardigans. Crochet is an amazing skill to have and helps one unwind after a long day and has kept me sane during the pandemic. 
        Below are some of my recent projects!
